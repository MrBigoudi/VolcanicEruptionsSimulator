Simulation of fluids in 3D are well studied in the literature either for Lagrangian solvers or Eulerian methods. Usually these simulations come at high cost, requiring millions of particles to reproduce small scale effects. 
A way to reduce this cost, as used in \textit{insert citation}, is to solve only two components in the 3D space hence reducing the number of operations and the internal size of the simulation.

- SWE for non-uniform terrain \cite{RodrguezPaz2005ACS} (but uniform particles, i.e. same height everywhere)
