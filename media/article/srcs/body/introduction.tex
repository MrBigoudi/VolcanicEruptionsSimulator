\section{Introduction}

Being able to simulate lava flows in a physically accurate manner can lead to both visually stunning results and a useful prediction tool to prevent causalities of real eruptions. During eruptions, the flow of lava can be seen as a pretty thin layer of fluid; this observation leads us to the idea of using shallow water equations\cite{Solenthaler2011SPHBS} to simulate the flow.
