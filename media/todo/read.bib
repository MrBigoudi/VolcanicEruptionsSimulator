abstract = {In this article we present a novel surface reconstruction method for particle-based fluid simulators such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. In particle-based simulations, fluid surfaces are usually defined as a level set of an implicit function. We formulate the implicit function as a sum of anisotropic smoothing kernels, and the direction of anisotropy at a particle is determined by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over the neighboring particles. In addition, we perform a smoothing step that repositions the centers of these smoothing kernels. Since these anisotropic smoothing kernels capture the local particle distributions more accurately, our method has advantages over existing methods in representing smooth surfaces, thin streams, and sharp features of fluids. Our method is fast, easy to implement, and our results demonstrate a significant improvement in the quality of reconstructed surfaces as compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {Realistically animated fluids can add substantial realism to interactive applications such as virtual surgery simulators or computer games. In this paper we propose an interactive method based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate fluids with free surfaces. The method is an extension of the SPH-based technique by Desbrun to animate highly deformable bodies. We gear the method towards fluid simulation by deriving the force density fields directly from the Navier-Stokes equation and by adding a term to model surface tension effects. In contrast to Eulerian grid-based approaches, the particle-based approach makes mass conservation equations and convection terms dispensable which reduces the complexity of the simulation. In addition, the particles can directly be used to render the surface of the fluid. We propose methods to track and visualize the free surface using point splatting and marching cubes-based surface reconstruction. Our animation method is fast enough to be used in interactive systems and to allow for user interaction with models consisting of up to 5000 particles.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a 2D particle-based approach to achieve realistic water surface behaviors for interactive applications. We formulate 2D particle-based Shallow Water equations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Particles defined with specific amount of water volume interplay with each other, which generates the horizon flow and the water surface motion. By the application of the particle-based Lagrangian framework to the 2D Shallow Water simulation, our method allows the water particles to move freely without being confined to a grid. The motion of the particles can represent global flow with dynamic waves covering a large area while avoiding extensive 3D fluid dynamics computation. The 2D particle-based Shallow Water equations are straightforward and computed fast with the GPU-based implementation. Experiments on a standard hardware demonstrate the performance of our approach which is running on the GPU, and the results show a realistic motion of the water surface at interactive rates.},

abstract = {We present a novel implicit formulation for highly viscous fluids simulated with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics SPH. Compared to explicit methods, our formulation is significantly more efficient and handles a larger range of viscosities. Differing from existing implicit formulations, our approach reconstructs the velocity field from a target velocity gradient. This gradient encodes a desired shear-rate damping and preserves the velocity divergence that is introduced by the SPH pressure solver to counteract density deviations. The target gradient ensures that pressure and viscosity computation do not interfere. Therefore, only one pressure projection step is required, which is in contrast to state-of-the-art implicit Eulerian formulations. While our model differs from true viscosity in that vorticity diffusion is not encoded in the target gradient, it nevertheless captures many of the qualitative behaviors of viscous liquids. Our formulation can easily be incorporated into complex scenarios with one- and two-way coupled solids and multiple fluid phases with different densities and viscosities.},

abstract = {We present a novel, incompressible fluid simulation method based on the Lagrangian Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) model. In our method, incompressibility is enforced by using a prediction-correction scheme to determine the particle pressures. For this, the information about density fluctuations is actively propagated through the fluid and pressure values are updated until the targeted density is satisfied. With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the WCSPH results.},
