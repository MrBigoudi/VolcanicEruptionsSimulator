abstract = {Animating fluids like water, smoke, and fire by physics-based simulation is increasingly important in visual effects and is starting to make an impact in real-time games. This course goes from the basics of 3D fluid flow to the state of the art in graphics. We will begin with an intuitive explanation of the important concepts in fluid simulation, and as we progress demonstrate how to implement an effective smoke and water simulation system, complete with irregular curved boundaries and surface tension. The last half of the course will cover advanced topics such as fire and explosions, adaptive grid methods, real-time-capable algorithms together with the latest technology in hardware acceleration, and non-Newtonian fluids like sand. Intuition and implementation details will be underscored throughout.},

abstract = {We propose a novel scheme for simulating two-way coupled interactions between nonlinear elastic solids and incompressible fluids. The key ingredient of this approach is a ghost matrix operator-splitting scheme for strongly coupled nonlinear elastica and incompressible fluids through the weak form of their governing equations. This leads to a stable and efficient method handling large time steps under the CFL limit while using a single monolithic solve for the coupled pressure fields, even in the case with highly nonlinear elastic solids. The use of the Material Point Method (MPM) is essential in the designing of the scheme, it not only preserves discretization consistency with the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian fluid solver, but also works naturally with our novel interface quadrature (IQ) discretization for free-slip boundary conditions. While traditional MPM suffers from sticky numerical artifacts, our framework naturally supports discontinuous tangential velocities at the solid-fluid interface. Our IQ discretization results in an easy-to-implement, fully particle-based treatment of the interfacial boundary, avoiding the additional complexities associated with intermediate level set or explicit mesh representations. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is verified by various challenging simulations with fluid-elastica interactions.},

abstract = {We present two new approaches for animating dynamic fracture involving large elastoplastic deformation. In contrast to traditional mesh-based techniques, where sharp discontinuity is introduced to split the continuum at crack surfaces, our methods are based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) with a variational energy-based formulation for crack evolution. Our first approach formulates the resulting dynamic material damage evolution with a Ginzburg-Landau type phase-field equation and discretizes it with the Material Point Method (MPM), resulting in a coupled momentum/damage solver rooted in phase field fracture: PFF-MPM. Although our PFF-MPM approach achieves convincing fracture with or without plasticity, we also introduce a return mapping algorithm that can be analytically solved for a wide range of general non-associated plasticity models, achieving more than two times speedup over traditional iterative approaches. To demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, we also develop a Non-Associated Cam-Clay (NACC) plasticity model with a novel fracture-friendly hardening scheme. Our NACC plasticity paired with traditional MPM composes a second approach to dynamic fracture, as it produces a breadth of organic, brittle material fracture effects on its own. Though NACC and PFF can be combined, we focus on exploring their material effects separately. Both methods can be easily integrated into any existing MPM solver, enabling the simulation of various fracturing materials with extremely high visual fidelity while requiring little additional computational overhead.},

The depth values outside of this range are carefully handled to achieve the desired surface shape near discontinuities. The simplicity of our formulation leads to a computationally efficient filter. We present examples with complex particle-based fluid simulations and provide comparisons, clearly showing that our filter provides improved surface quality in terms of surface smoothness and preserving boundaries near discontinuities, as compared to prior filtering methods.},

abstract = {We present an approach for rendering the surface of a particle-based fluid that is simple to implement, has real-time performance with a configurable speed/quality trade-off, and smoothes the surface to prevent the fluid from looking "blobby" or jelly-like. The method is not based on polygonization and as such circumvents the usual grid artifacts of marching cubes. It only renders the surface where it is visible, and has inherent view-dependent level-of-detail. We use Perlin noise to add detail to the surface of the fluid. All the processing, rendering and shading steps are directly implemented on graphics hardware.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

abstract = {Long-term erosional modifications of the relatively simple morphology of scoria (`cinder') cones are ideally suited for study by field and computer-simulation methods. A series of temporally-distinct cones in the San Francisco and Springerville volcanic fields of Arizona provides the foundation for documenting the degradational evolution of scoria cones in a semi-arid climate. Progressive changes due to erosion are illustrated by the systematic decrease with increasing age of various morphometric parameters, including scoria cone height, cone height/width ratio (Hco/Wco), crater depth/width ratio, and slope angle. For example, Holocene–latest Pleistocene cones in the San Francisco field have a mean Hco/Wco value of 0.178±0.041, a mean maximum slope angle of 29.7±4.2°, and a mean average slope angle of 26.4±7.3°, whereas the group of Pliocene cones have values of 0.077±0.024, 20.5±5.8°, and 8.7±2.7°, respectively. Comparative morphology of scoria cones is a potentially useful dating tool for mapping volcanic fields. In order to better understand the degradational modifications of these volcanic landforms, we have developed a numerical approach to simulate the surficial processes responsible for the erosion of a typical scoria cone. The simulation algorithm can apply either a linear diffusion-equation model or a model with a nonlinear transport law. Using a finite-difference formulation, the simulation operates upon a three-dimensional scoria cone input as a matrix of elevation values. Utilizing both field and model results, the correlation between changing Hco/Wco value, cone age, and computer time step was expressed graphically to derive comprehensive values of the transport or diffusion coefficient (Df) for both volcanic fields. For the San Francisco volcanic field, Df had a calculated value of 21.4 m2/kyr for the linear model and 5.3 m/kyr for the nonlinear model, while for the Springerville volcanic field Df had a calculated value of 24.4 m2/kyr for the linear model and 6.3 m/kyr for the nonlinear model.}
